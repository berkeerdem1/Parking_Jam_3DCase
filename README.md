Parking_Jam_3DCase: My clone game containing the first 3 levels of Parking Jam 3D.

To open the game in Unity:

Unity Hub and Unity must be installed on your computer. If not, you can download them from this link: https://unity.com/download
After downloading the zip file of the project, we complete the Unity Hub folder.
He suggested that you open the project with Unity version 2023.1.11f1 to open it without any problems.
You can access the assets I used in the project from the assetStore or the Package Manager in Unity. All assets are free.
If you have problems after downloading the PathCreator asset, you can get help from the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saAQNRSYU9k&t=309s.
